## Description
I was given a challenge to create a password generator. To begin this challenge I was given simple starter code which includes HTML and CSS.
In the challenge I was asked to have a password generator that asks the user criteria using certain prompts including character length, symbols, capital letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. I also edited some of the CSS and HTML code that I believe created a better user experience including adding colors and more specific communication. The password generator is healthy and effective.
