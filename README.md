## Description
I was given a challenge to create a password generator. To begin this challenge I was given simple starter code which includes HTML,CSS, and a small amount of Javascript. I added lots of comments into the js.script page to use this challenge as a good javascript reference.
In the challenge I was asked to have a password generator that asks the user criteria using certain prompts including character length, symbols, capital letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. I also edited some of the CSS and HTML code that I believe created a better user experience including adding colors and more specific communication. I have also added a 'Copy Password' button for a better user experience. The password generator is healthy and effective.
